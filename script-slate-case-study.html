          <p class="case-large-body">The entertainment industry is stuck using spreadsheets to track complex projects when it should have the modern products other industries enjoy. With thousands of screenplays changing hands in Hollywood everyday, Script Slate wants to give executives, producers, and indie filmmakers the user experience they deserve to easily organize material and submissions. That way, they have more time to be creative and make content for everyone to enjoy.</p>

          <p class="case-large-body">To ensure Script Slate could carve out a niche in the cloud market, I examined three competitors: Google Drive, Dropbox, and Evernote. They had many strengths such as the ability to upload multiple kinds of files, good design, and folder-based organization. However, none of them had tracking capabilities for files or incorporated contacts that would greatly enhance the Hollywood workflow.</p>

              <p>29 Y/O aspiring filmmaker from Los Angeles</p>

              <h2>Goals</h2>
              <ul>
                <li >I want to easily track who I've sent my scripts to</li>
                <li >I want to send my material to my contacts on the fly</li>
                <li >I want to be able to access all my material in one central place</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Frustrations</h2>
              <ul>
                <li >Sometimes I send the wrong version of a script, and I have to resend the correct one</li>
                <li >I hate remembering a bunch of passwords for different services</li>
                <li >Creating script breakdowns for my projects is time-consuming</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Motivations</h2>
              <p>While she’s always been a hard worker, Lauren has never been the most organized worker. She usually keeps her files in minimal folders, choosing instead to search for the files she needs while editing. Lauren realizes this method won’t help her find funding for her own project, and she needs to be more organized as she sends the script out to producers and potential investors.</p>

              <h2>Frustrations</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>I have to remind some people to look at their assigned materials over and over</li>
                <li>Notes on material can be hard to track or format when they are in other documents</li>
                <li>Sometimes I forget to follow up on material I've sent out to colleagues</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Motivations</h2>
              <p>Ethan is the go-to guy at work when someone has a questions about a project. He’s responsible for tracking all the scripts that the company is submitted, assigning them to assistants to be read, and passing the good ones up the chain of command. Ethan also submits the company’s projects to potential buyers around town, and tracks the status of the ones that have been bought. He has a lot of fluid information to track, and staying on top of it without frying his brain is his main goal.</p>

            <p>The app was originally planned to assist with a unique meeting in Hollywood called a weekend read, and the name for the app was going to be Weekend Speed. However, the user research showed that 60% of people didn’t have a weekend read at their companies so a pivot was called for. I sent out another survey with potential names generated by analyzing the problems users actually wanted solved. They voted for Script Slate. In Hollywood, “slate” is a term that refers to a company’s list of projects or their “slate.”

                <p>The logo resembles the material cards the user will see in the app when viewing all their uploaded material. The simple geometric shapes and simple design communicate the organized and clean feel of the app. The staggered layout forms the shape of an “S” for Script Slate. Furthermore, the clean, plain squares resemble a slab of slate.</p>

              <p>I chose purple for the logo since it combines the passion of red and the professionalism of blue. The color psychology also communicates our creative brand. Blue and orange are the two most commonly used contrasting colors in movie posters so they were a natural choice for accents. The muted red orange ties the accents back into the purple, and is used for actions with a more negative connotation. The various gray shades allow for more multi-dimensional designs without distracting the eye.</p>

              <p>The combination of these two sans serif typefaces gives the brand a professional, future-forward look without losing any legibility. Poppins is the brand typeface since it has square ends that match the logomark. These and all the other branding elements were then compiled into a comprehensive style guide.</p>

          <p>With my user flows clearly mapped out, I could begin planning what the application would look like with wireframe sketches that I turned into digital wireframes. Then, I created a clickable prototype in order to get some early feedback from potential users. I asked them to complete three tasks: sign up for an account, upload a piece of material, and move a piece of material into a given folder.
            <br><br>Their feedback focused primarily on the orientation of a “more options” icon as the prototype did not allow them to click and drag items, which is their preferred method of manipulating material. I remembered this moving forward into high-fidelity wireframes.</p>

                <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
                <p>The product is far from done, however. I’d like to implement a way to track everyone a certain piece of material has been sent to in the past so the product can suggest new contacts the user may have missed. I’d also like to conduct tests to see if users would like a social aspect where people could specify what kind of material they are looking for so that their contacts would be able to send them targeted material.</p>
