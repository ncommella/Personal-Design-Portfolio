          <p class="small-body">The entertainment industry is stuck using spreadsheets to track complex projects when it should have the modern products other industries enjoy. With thousands of screenplays changing hands in Hollywood everyday, Script Slate wants to give executives, producers, and indie filmmakers the user experience they deserve to easily organize material and submissions. That way, they have more time to be creative and make content for everyone to enjoy.</p>

          <p>To ensure Script Slate could carve out a niche in the cloud market, I examined three competitors: Google Drive, Dropbox, and Evernote. They had many strengths such as the ability to upload multiple kinds of files, good design, and folder-based organization. However, none of them had tracking capabilities for files or incorporated contacts that would greatly enhance the Hollywood workflow.</p>

          </div>
          <p>The app was originally planned to assist with a unique meeting in Hollywood called a weekend read, and the name for the app was going to be Weekend Speed. However, the user research showed that 60% of people didn’t have a weekend read at their companies so a pivot was called for. I sent out another survey with potential names generated by analyzing the problems users actually wanted solved. They voted for Script Slate. In Hollywood, “slate” is a term that refers to a company’s list of projects or their “slate.”
          <br><br>With a new name selected, I set to work developing a logo.</p>
        </section>

        <!--Logos Section-->
        <section class="case-section">

          </div>

            <p>The logo resembles the material cards the user will see in the app when viewing all their uploaded material. The simple geometric shapes and simple design communicate the organized and clean feel of the app. The staggered layout forms the shape of an “S” for Script Slate. Furthermore, the clean, plain squares resemble a slab of slate.</p>

            </div>
            <p>I chose purple for the logo since it combines the passion of red and the professionalism of blue. The color psychology also communicates our creative brand. Blue and orange are the two most commonly used contrasting colors in movie posters so they were a natural choice for accents. The muted red orange ties the accents back into the purple, and is used for actions with a more negative connotation. The various gray shades allow for more multi-dimensional designs without distracting the eye.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The combination of these two sans serif typefaces gives the brand a professional, future-forward look without losing any legibility. Poppins is the brand typeface since it has square ends that match the logomark.</p>

          </div>

          <p>With my user flows clearly mapped out, I could begin planning what the application would look like with wireframe sketches that I turned into digital wireframes. Then, I created a clickable prototype in order to get some early feedback from potential users. I asked them to complete three tasks: sign up for an account, upload a piece of material, and move a piece of material into a given folder.
            <br><br>Their feedback focused primarily on the orientation of a “more options” icon as the prototype did not allow them to click and drag items, which is their preferred method of manipulating material. I remembered this moving forward into high-fidelity wireframes.</p>

          <h1 class="case-header">Conclusion</h1>

            <p>In conclusion, the cloud storage industry is filled with some big players, and the list of them is only growing larger. I feel as though I’ve found a niche market that has been underserved in respect to specialized platforms.</p>

            <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
            <p>The product is far from done, however. I’d like to implement a way to track everyone a certain piece of material has been sent to in the past so the product can suggest new contacts the user may have missed. I’d also like to conduct tests to see if users would like a social aspect where people could specify what kind of material they are looking for so that their contacts would be able to send them targeted material.</p>



            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
            <p>I had doubts about the need after 60% of potential users didn’t have weekend read meetings, but I feel I’ve created an MVP that users with or without those meetings at their companies would find useful since I addressed the most pressing concerns found from my research.</p>
